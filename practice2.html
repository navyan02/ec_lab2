            They put me in the oven to bake.
            Me, a deprived and miserable cake.
            Feeling the heat, I started to bubble.
            Watching the others, I knew I was in trouble.

            They opened the door and I started my life.
            Frosting me with a silver knife,
            Decorating me with candy jewels.
            The rest of my batch looked like fools.

            Lifting me up, she took off my wrapper.
            Feeling the breeze, I wanted to slap her.
            Opening her mouth with shiny teeth inside,
            This was the day this cupcake died.
